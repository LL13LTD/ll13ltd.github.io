Our games comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). We do not knowingly collect, use, or share personal information from children under 13 years of age.


INFORMATION COLLECTION

We do not directly collect any personal information. Our games do not require registration, login, or any user input of personal data.

Third-Party Services: Our games use Google AdMob to display advertisements. When our games are marked as child-directed, Google AdMob operates in COPPA-compliant mode and:
- Does not serve personalized advertisements
- Limits data collection to only what is necessary for ad delivery
- May collect limited technical information such as device type, operating system version, and general geographic location (country/region level only)

Some of our games offer optional in-app purchases (such as removing advertisements). These transactions are processed through Google Play or the Apple App Store, and we do not collect or store any payment information.


DATA STORAGE

We use local device storage only to save game progress and settings on your device. This data never leaves your device and is not transmitted to our servers or any third parties.

Parents or guardians may contact us at any time to:
- Review any information we may have about their child
- Request deletion of any such information
- Refuse to permit further collection of information
